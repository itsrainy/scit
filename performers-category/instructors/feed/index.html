Since then he has been performing regularly on various teams: From house teams (Smack &amp; Cheese, Thunderpants, Fervor, One Hand Luke), to independent teams (Yeah Those Guys, USS Improvise). You may also find him dressed in black, wearing a beret as he performs with Remy Porter in the bombastic faux-art duo, Gestalt. Outside Pittsburgh, his teams have performed at improv festivals in New York (DCM) and Chicago (CIF).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ciarán has coached house teams at SCIT (I Dream of Feeny, Vintage Quaid) as well as independent teams (The Deep End, Classy &amp; Relevant) and several duos. His improv philosophy is the same as the sign that greets you in the SCIT lobby: &#8220;You are enough!&#8221;</div>
