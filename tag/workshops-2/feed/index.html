				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arthur Simone is an artist, actor and co-founder of <a title="ColdTowne Theater" href="http://www.coldtownetheater.com" target="_blank">ColdTowne Theater</a> in Austin, TX.  A graduate of Oberlin College, he has studied improv at Chicago&#8217;s Improv Olympic and has appeared on-screen in Days of Delusion, Jigsaw, The Evil One, A&amp;E&#8217;s Faith of My Fathers, Big Momma&#8217;s House 2, and has been featured on the series Friday Night Lights. He was recently named Best Actor by the Austin Chronicle for his performance in his one-man show, Dear Frailty.</p>
<p><em> </em>Next Thursday, Steel City Improv Theater welcomes Arthur Simone to the stage for a workshop on character. Get to know him a little better, as he takes five of our questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Tell us about your first improv experience. What inspired you to start?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had seen improv before, but had written it off as goofball &#8220;low art,&#8221;<br />
devoting myself instead to pursuing a super expensive degree in<br />
theatre. I put it to use stage and film acting in Chicago before<br />
taking a suggestion from my agent and trying classes at Improv<br />
Olympic, where I discovered &#8220;everyday&#8221; performers making amazing<br />
truthful in-the-moment choices that trumped anything I had ever seen.<br />
I still value my college degree and it gives me great insight into<br />
emotion and characters, but boy, do I wish I had gotten into improv<br />
earlier!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>You wear many hats, creatively—acting, improv, art and even air guitar—is there anything you haven’t done that you would like to do?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I never want to choose the One Thing I&#8217;m good at, so I guess that<br />
means I&#8217;ll be flitting about in perpetual anxiety about where my next<br />
paycheck is coming from for some time yet&#8230; I generally work in one<br />
discipline until I feel I&#8217;m beating my head against the wall, then<br />
drop it entirely to delve into something else that recharges my<br />
batteries. In the immediate future, I&#8217;d like to try my hand at working<br />
behind the camera instead of in front of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Who/where do you think are some current improv innovators (people, troupes, companies, cities)?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Austin is a great melting pot of styles and allows for lots of stage<br />
time and cross-pollination. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the<br />
industry-obsessed landscape of Los Angeles, New York or Chicago, but<br />
you will find some pretty amazing and elite talent to watch if you&#8217;re<br />
looking for inspiration. TJ &amp; Dave, 3303, Dasariski and Death by Roo<br />
Roo have all at one point blown my mind all over the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>What are some of your favorite improv resources?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While I don&#8217;t really read many books on improv, I do love books on<br />
theatre&#8217;s place in culture, like Antonin Artaud, Peter Brook and Jerzy<br />
Grotowski. Humans are fundamentally social animals, so there&#8217;s a great<br />
deal of insight to be found in nature documentaries as well, I watch<br />
them obsessively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Your workshop focuses on character. What do you hope the main takeaway will be?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A character is more than just a silly accent or even a deeper<br />
motivation, it&#8217;s a unique skin into which the actor can step to see<br />
and experience a world. Realistic and absurd characters alike can be<br />
deep wells of material, and there&#8217;s no feeling quite like bringing one<br />
to life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Author&#8217;s Note: We&#8217;re hoping to make this a regular column, so you can get to know our instructors, frequent players and guests a little better. If there&#8217;s someone you think we should &#8220;take five&#8221; with, let us know!  -Kat</em></p>
