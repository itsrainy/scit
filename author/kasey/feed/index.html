<p><a href="http://steelcityimprov.com/shop/find-game-2017-12-09-conroy/">CHECK OUT SEAN&#8217;S WORKSHOP</a></p>
<p>In his new stand-up show “The <em>World&#8217;s Smallest Giant</em>,” stand-up <em>Sean Conroy</em> (ASSSSCAT, Mr. Pickles) explores fistfights, heartbreak, the Kiss of Death, miracles, and how Showtime Lakers power forward Kurt Rambis could actually heal the <em>world</em>.</p>
<p>Acerbic, quick-witted comedian<strong> Sean Conroy</strong> is self-lacerating and constantly annoyed- at himself and everybody else- but always manages to sneak in a healthy dose of silliness and joyful charm. Splitsider.com describes him as “intimidatingly smart, intimidatingly funny, and just plain intimidating.” He’s a multi-disciplined comedy tour-de-force. As a stand-up, Sean’s performed on Conan and Comedy Central. As an improviser, he was a founding member of the first ever house team at <a href="http://ucbtheater.com/">The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater</a>, legendary improv group The Swarm, and has been a regular in the UCB’s flagship show ASSSSCAT for almost twenty years (in fact they asked him to perform with them when they recorded their live show for Shout Factory, still available on DVD).  He’s been a television writer for over a decade (<em>Key &amp; Peele, Crossballs, Dog Bites Man, Gentlemen Lobsters, Players, Love Inc.),</em> most recently finishing up his third season as head writer of Adult Swim’s cult favorite <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2950342/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Mr. Pickles</a>,</em> about a dog who’s sort of like Lassie (except he worships Satan, and is a serial killer). He’s hosted over 325 episodes of his podcast, <em><a href="http://www.thelongshotpodcast.com/">The Long Shot</a> </em>(which the AV Club calls “rollicking” and “a consistent delight”).  He enjoys good coffee, mediocre whiskey, and ship novels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SCIT is proud and super excited to welcome Philip Markle, the Executive Director of Annoyance Theater NY, to The Maker Theater on Saturday, August 8th, 2015 from 1pm-4pm.  Philip is bringing the unique style of improvisation he teaches at the Annoyance Theater in New York.</p>
<p>Founded 25 years ago, the Annoyance Theater is a home to Chicago&#8217;s longest running musical. It also has a reputation for providing excellent quality training in improvisation. Based on Mick Napier’s book Improvise. Scene From the Inside Out, the Annoyance philosophy focuses on the individual, giving students feedback and support to allow them to find and enhance their personal point of view and creative voice.</p>
<p>This Annoyance Theatre improv workshop will give improvisers a foundation in the Annoyance philosophy of what it means to play with abandonment, withhold judgement, and commit to your characters and choices. Let’s agree that there is no right or wrong choice – just a weak or strong one – and see what happens when we give ourselves a powerful choice right off the top. This workshop will move quickly and challenge you with personal and specific feedback to help you think on your feet and find your own voice. And have a kick-ass time doing so.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://steelcityimprov.com/shop/kick-ass-commitment-2015-8-8-2/">Click here to sign up for this workshop!  Spots are limited.</a></h5>
