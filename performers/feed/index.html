				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Acerbic, quick-witted comedian Sean Conroy is self-lacerating and constantly annoyed- at himself and everybody else- but always manages to sneak in a healthy dose of silliness and joyful charm. Splitsider.com describes him as “intimidatingly smart, intimidatingly funny, and just plain intimidating.” He’s a multidisciplined comedy tour-de-force. As a stand-up, Sean’s performed on Conan and Comedy Central. As animproviser, he was a founding member of the first ever house team at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, legendary improv group The Swarm, and has been a regular in the UCB’s flagship show ASSSSCAT for almost twenty years (in fact they asked him to perform with them when they recorded their live show for Shout Factory, still available on DVD). He’s been a television writer for over a decade (Crossballs, Dog Bites Man, Key &amp; Peele), most recently finishing up his third season as head writer of Adult Swim’s cult favorite Mr. Pickles, about a dog who’s sort of like Lassie (except he worships Satan, and is a serial killer). He’s hosted over three hundred episodes of his podcast, The Long Shot (which the AV Club calls “rollicking” and “a consistent delight”). He enjoys good coffee, mediocre whiskey, and ship novels.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sue had dreams of being a stand-up comedian since high school, but was terrified of public speaking. She learned to overcome her fears and became a stand-up trainer instead. Sue is able to embed lots of humor into her courses. During CPR and First Aid classes, she frequently tells stories about her family’s many misadventures and how she gets to practice first aid skills regularly! While Sue has absolutely no acting or theater background, she fell in love with improv after her first class with Justin Zell at SCIT in late 2014. She completed Level 1, 2 and 3 classes and loves being on a House Team with an awesome group of performers. When Sue isn’t performing or taking improv classes, she can be found reenacting as a Women’s Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) at WWII events with her husband’s unit, the 82nd Airborne, 508 Parachute Infantry Regiment, Living Historical Unit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #222222;">During the Polar Vortex of 2014, Scott was afraid that his growing introversion and the deadly Netflix/Hulu combo might get the best of him. So out he ventured into the freezing cold to attend his first improv class. One year and five classes later Scott can be seen socializing, engaging in conversation, and attempting to make people laugh. Scott is Penn State grad, a daydreamer, a master procrastinator, and lives by the motto, &#8220;fake it &#8217;til you make it&#8221;. You can catch Scott and his sweet dance moves Monday evenings during TFM.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Andrea is originally from Canton, OH and comes from a family she adores that loves to laugh, and gets seriously competitive with party games. She moved to Pittsburgh after college to marry a smokin’ hot Mennonite named Kyle, and they live in Highland Park. Andrea discovered Steel City Improv Theater at an improv workshop for entrepreneurs led by Justin Zell, and was drawn instantly to the values of improv. She started taking classes at the SCIT in the spring of 2014 and has been on an improv bender ever since. When she’s not improvising, she can often be found writing sketches, tripping over herself at a Zumba class, talking too loudly in public, or laughing with friends until someone has a snot bubble.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Molly is a 412 native with a soft spot for the Midwest.   She first escaped into improv while living in Madison, WI. Her quality of life instantly improved. In a pursuit of happiness she accepted a job that would relocate her to her cherished city. Upon returning home, she Googled &#8220;Impov in Pittsburgh&#8221; and added a Level 1 (and later Level 2) Steel City class into her virtual shopping cart. She is hoping to add Level 3 before the end of 2014.   Her workweek is spent at a tech start-up but her true passion is in reclaiming furniture. You might laugh, but she has what she affectionately refers to as her ‘coke-dream’ of one day opening a storefront. Until then, she invites the laughs on stage.</p>
